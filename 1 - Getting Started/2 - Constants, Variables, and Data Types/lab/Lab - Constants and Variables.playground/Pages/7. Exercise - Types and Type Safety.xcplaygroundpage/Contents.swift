/*:
 ## Exercise - Types and Type Safety
 
 Declare two variables, one called `firstDecimal` and one called `secondDecimal`. Both should have decimal values. Look at both of their types by holding Option and clicking on the variable name.
 */
var firstDecimal = 1.5
var secondDecimal = 2.4

/*:
 Declare a variable called `trueOrFalse` and give it a boolean value. Try to assign it to `firstDecimal` like so: `firstDecimal = trueOrFalse`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
 */
var firstDecimal = true
var secondDecimal = false
/*:
 Declare a variable and give it a string value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Does it compile? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
 */
var day = "Friday"
firstDecimal = day

/*:
 Finally, declare a variable with a whole number value. Then try to assign it to `firstDecimal`. Why won't this compile even though both variables are numbers? Print a statement to the console explaining why not, and remove the line of code that will not compile.
 */
var = 20
firstDecimal = 20
This dosen't work because is not a decimal number.
